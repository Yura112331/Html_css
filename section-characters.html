          <h1>Arya Stark</h1>
          <div class="block-text1">
            <p class="p1">
              Princess Arya Stark is the third child and second daughter of Lord
              Eddard Stark and his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark. She is the sister
              of the incumbent Westerosi monarchs, Sansa, Queen in the North,
              and Brandon, King of the Andals and the First Men.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
              After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by House
              Lannister, Arya is trained as a Faceless Man at the House of Black
              and White in Braavos, using her abilities to avenge her family.

            <p>
              Returning to Winterfell, Arya initially finds herself at odds with
              Sansa due to the na√Øvety of her youth and perceived lack of
              support for their "half-brother", Jon Snow, King in the North.
              However, their tumultuous relationship is discovered to be the
              result of Petyr Baelish's manipulation, and the two mend their
              sisterhood following his execution for his crimes against House
              Stark.

            <p>
              Arya then plays a significant role in the Great War, effectively
              ending the conflict through her killing of the Night King during
              the Battle of Winterfell. Afterwards, Arya rides south with Sandor
              Clegane to kill Cersei Lannister, not intent on returning to
              Winterfell. She arrives at King's Landing as it is being destroyed
              by Daenerys Targaryen. Sandor convinces Arya to abandon her quest
              for vengeance and Arya tries to help the smallfolk survive the
              destruction of King's Landing, though she fails. Weeks later,
              following Daenerys's assassination to stop her further
              destruction, Arya is part of the great council that decides the
              future of Westeros, during which Arya's younger brother Bran is
              chosen as king. After bidding farewell to her siblings, Arya
              decides to leave Westeros and sail west to discover what lies
              beyond where the maps of the known world end.

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <div class="content2">
          <p class="p3">
            Arya Stark is the youngest daughter and third child of Lady Catelyn
            and Lord Ned Stark.
          </p>
          <p class="p3">
            Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older sister,
            Sansa, an older brother Robb, two younger brothers Bran and Rickon
            Stark, and a "bastard half-brother" Jon Snow.
          </p>
          <p class="p3">
            Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and marry for
            influence and power. Instead, she believes that she can forge her
            own destiny. She is fascinated by warfare and training in the use of
            arms, and is bored by embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She
            takes after her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her
            sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and personalities.
            She is close to her "half-brother" Jon, who is also something of an
            outsider.

        <h3>Season 1</h3>
        <div class="content3">
          <p>
            On King Robert's visit to Winterfell, Arya rushes out to see the
            arrival of his entourage. She is scolded when she finally joins the
            receiving line in the courtyard. Arya is overheard by Queen Cersei
            when she asks Sansa where the "Imp" is, a reference to Tyrion. Later
            that evening at the feast, she tests her mother's patience by
            misbehaving and throwing food at her sister, prompting Robb to send
            her to bed early. Robert names Arya's father as his Hand of the
            King, Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa, and Eddard decides to take his
            daughters with him to King's Landing to experience the court. Before
            leaving, Arya receives a pet direwolf, one of several pups found by
            her brothers outside the castle, and names her Nymeria, after a
            great warrior-queen of Essos. She also receives a sword as a gift
            from Jon. She names it Needle, as a play on words that she may now
            enjoy doing "needlework".
