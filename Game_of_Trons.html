                  Princess Arya Stark is the third child and second daughter of
                  Lord Eddard Stark and his wife, Lady Catelyn Stark. She is the
                  sister of the incumbent Westerosi monarchs, Sansa, Queen in
                  the North, and Brandon, King of the Andals and the First Men.

                  After narrowly escaping the persecution of House Stark by
                  House Lannister, Arya is trained as a Faceless Man at the
                  House of Black and White in Braavos, using her abilities to
                  avenge her family.

                    Returning to Winterfell, Arya initially finds herself at
                    odds with Sansa due to the na√Øvety of her youth and
                    perceived lack of support for their "half-brother", Jon
                    Snow, King in the North. However, their tumultuous
                    relationship is discovered to be the result of Petyr
                    Baelish's manipulation, and the two mend their sisterhood
                    following his execution for his crimes against House Stark.

                    Arya then plays a significant role in the Great War,
                    effectively ending the conflict through her killing of the
                    Night King during the Battle of Winterfell. Afterwards, Arya
                    rides south with Sandor Clegane to kill Cersei Lannister,
                    not intent on returning to Winterfell. She arrives at King's
                    Landing as it is being destroyed by Daenerys Targaryen.
                    Sandor convinces Arya to abandon her quest for vengeance and
                    Arya tries to help the smallfolk survive the destruction of
                    King's Landing, though she fails. Weeks later, following
                    Daenerys's assassination to stop her further destruction,
                    Arya is part of the great council that decides the future of
                    Westeros, during which Arya's younger brother Bran is chosen
                    as king. After bidding farewell to her siblings, Arya
                    decides to leave Westeros and sail west to discover what
                    lies beyond where the maps of the known world end.

                      Arya was born and raised at Winterfell. She has an older
                      sister, Sansa, an older brother Robb, two younger brothers
                      Bran and Rickon Stark, and a "bastard half-brother" Jon
                      Snow.

                      Arya rejects the notion that she must become a lady and
                      marry for influence and power. Instead, she believes that
                      she can forge her own destiny. She is fascinated by
                      warfare and training in the use of arms, and is bored by
                      embroidery and other "lady-like" pursuits. She takes after
                      her father and has a quarrelsome relationship with her
                      sister Sansa, due to their contrasting interests and
                      personalities. She is close to her "half-brother" Jon, who
                      is also something of an outsider.

                  On King Robert's visit to Winterfell, Arya rushes out to see
                  the arrival of his entourage. She is scolded when she finally
                  joins the receiving line in the courtyard. Arya is overheard
                  by Queen Cersei when she asks Sansa where the "Imp" is, a
                  reference to Tyrion. Later that evening at the feast, she
                  tests her mother's patience by misbehaving and throwing food
                  at her sister, prompting Robb to send her to bed early. Robert
                  names Arya's father as his Hand of the King, Joffrey is
                  betrothed to Sansa, and Eddard decides to take his daughters
                  with him to King's Landing to experience the court. Before
                  leaving, Arya receives a pet direwolf, one of several pups
                  found by her brothers outside the castle, and names her
                  Nymeria, after a great warrior-queen of Essos. She also
                  receives a sword as a gift from Jon. She names it Needle, as a
                  play on words that she may now enjoy doing "needlework".
